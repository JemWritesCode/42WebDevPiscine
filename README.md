# 42WebDevPiscine
[42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/)'s web development course. Each project has a time limit(usually 1-2 days) with all of the projects being completed over a 2 week period total.

Projects are done in CSS, HTML, Javascript, PHP, Node.js

AKA PHP Piscine, but I'm focusing on Node.js since it's more modern.

#### Ex01:
Ex03 is Ex01 but responsive, so just go ahead and make ex01 responsive and save yourself some time. 

I used a [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and a class for .element .symbol .atomicWeight and .atomicNumber. I tweaked a spreadsheet from my friend which generated the code for each element using a formula that read the element's info. This speeded things up considerably.

#### Ex02: 
Ex05 is Ex02 but built out into a full game. Try to think of how to make your classes reusable for building things out.
To make things clickable on the image you can use GIMP to create areas for a [HTML Image Map.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_map.asp)

#### Ex04:
I suppose one simply adds a dropdown.

#### Ex05:
Making the game work -- the actions on the left and the items on the right can be used on things in the image maps in the middle.

## Day01
I was short on time this day and only got to ex07. I probably spent too long on Day00Ex05(but no regrets, that was fun!)

Use RegEx and you can make the function 1 line.
