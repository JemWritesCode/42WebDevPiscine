#### Ex01:
Ex03 is Ex01 but responsive, so just go ahead and make ex01 responsive and save yourself some time. 

I used a [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and a class for .element .symbol .atomicWeight and .atomicNumber

#### Ex02: 
Ex05 is Ex02 but built out into a full game. Try to think of how to make your classes reusable for building things out.
